# Voice-Recognition

The voice recognition project is a Python application that integrates a graphical user interface (GUI) with real-time speech-to-text conversion. Using the tkinter library, the program provides a simple and user-friendly interface where users can press a button to initiate voice recording. The audio is captured through the microphone, processed by the speech_recognition library, and then converted into text using Googleâ€™s Web Speech API. The recognized text is displayed directly in the GUI, making it easy for users to see the transcribed output.
